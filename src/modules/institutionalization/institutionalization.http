Such emergency tactics, processes, systems are supported by research and universally accepted by professional associations and communities of practice as standards and norms. Therefore training of emergency responders must keep up with the evolving science of practice to ensure that quality and standards are maintained in managing emergencies and reduce unnecessary loss of lives and disabilities of disaster-affected communities. Under the leadership of nodal agencies and support from national technical agencies, a system needs to be in place to regularly review, update and revise national standard curricula. A national working group needs to be in place to lead the review process or a committee if it’s an institutional level review, ideally after every 2-3 years. Quick updates and minor revisions might also occur immediately after a training activity as part of continuous improvement of the training materials.

Developing after-training reports should be a standard practice to document lessons from individual activities and recommendations on how the overall training activity can be improved next time.",

At the time, Prof. Gamage held the position of Senior Lecturer and was also the Director of the Computing Services Centre at the University of Moratuwa. He drafted a proposal for creating an institute of information technology within UoM and forwarded it to Hon. Kingsley T. Wickramaratne, who was the Minister of Internal and International Commerce and Food at that time. In June 1998, the Ministry of Education and Higher Education and the Ministry of Internal and International Commerce and Food jointly brought a proposal to the Cabinet to have the Malabe institute funded by the Mahapola Trust Fund and provided with land. The Chairman of the MTF, who was always the Chief Justice, was consulted on this matter. Although the Cabinet agreed to the project in principle, the Ministry of Finance expressed concerns about the lack of qualified academics to teach at the new institute and the financial burden it would place on the Consolidated Fund.[8][9]\n\nIn 1999, Prof. Gamage requested a meeting with Mr. Wickramarathne, the Minister of Internal and International Commerce and Food, to discuss the creation of an institute. The meeting involved Ministry officials, professionals, and academics, and it was proposed to form a company limited by guarantee as an interim measure. This would allow for the project to move forward until cabinet approval was obtained, at which point the Government could take over the Institute and attach it to the University of Moratuwa."

These training principles have transformed how training is conducted in the countries and have created strong advocates from the emergency response community, especially PEER alumni. Such training standards have even gone beyond PEER training applied to other training programs implemented by partners. However, having such rigid training standards also has some downside in which not all implementing institutions can comply. This led to the creation of parallel training of the same theme to separate PEER standards and what the partners consider the practical application of the standards. To address this issue and promote having standard training by the country and institutions, PEER training standards need to be adapted according to the capacities and current training system set up of implementing institutions. Therefore, PEER advocates for establishing minimum training standards that nodal agencies will endorse and promote, and implementing institutions can adapt. Furthermore, such measures should be established and documented to encourage implementing partners to apply to ensure quality and standardize implementation of training activities in the country.",

When PEER started in the early part of 2000, such national guidelines are in varying degrees of development. The practice of disaster risk management is at the early stages of its evolution at the national level. The absence of national operational guidelines was evident in PEER curricula that mainly reflected in its training materials universally accepted norms usually used in western countries. As part of enhancing more robust integration of national operational standards in the adapted PEER curricula, upgrading such standards in line with minimum global norms is critical for training activities to be institutionalized at the national level. This will enable emergency responders to get trained on national operational standards through the PEER courses. Standardization also promotes interoperability of national and local response, including from international disaster response teams, during large-scale disasters.",

The country needs to integrate exercises as part of its emergency preparedness culture regularly conducted. An adequately documented exercise plan, available expertise to design, conduct and evaluate exercise through an After Action Review are fundamental elements that need to be in place in simulation exercises.

This will facilitate the inclusion of PEER courses in institutional work programs of national partners and contribute to achieving targets from the said national policy documents. Furthermore, some countries have national frameworks related to emergency response (e.g. USAR, Prehospital Care, Incident Management System, Emergency Medical Service, volunteer management, etc.). Therefore, PEER can be integrated into the capacity development program for volunteers, professional responders, and hospital personnel. Regional agreements like the SAARC Agreement on Rapid Response to Natural Disasters under Article V Standard Operating Procedures on preparedness provide string linkages on the country’s commitment. The provision stipulates the development of individual or joint plans to facilitate regional cooperation on response. PEER countries can consider future programming as part of the country’s commitment as a signatory in the agreement. The agreement is one of the objectives in the SAARC Comprehensive Framework on Disaster Management that provide a platform for regional cooperation on disaster mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery.",

These programs are supported by donor agencies implemented through various stakeholders ranging from Red Cross / Red Crescent National Societies, local NGOs, training, and academic institutions, including the private sector. Having national standard training curricula, partners can strongly advocate for its use to leverage resources outside PEER. In doing so, the country and the beneficiaries of training activities can promote the national standard curricula regardless of who is leading or funding the program.A possible strategy that implementing institutions can explore is to engage the private sector through its corporate social responsibility program that mainly involves community outreach. The private sector's best interest is to support preparedness activities to reduce disaster impact in their business. It can be in the form of well-trained personnel on lifesaving skills, safety in the workplace, and other preparedness activities to support SMEs in protecting the business supply chain or the surrounding communities where most employees reside. A partnership can be explored with private  hospitals on preparedness and enhance disaster resilience like what public hospitals are benefiting from HOPE. Private hospitals can reduce disruptions and continue operating even after a significant disaster impact and increase national treatment capacity for emergency patients considering that more than 50% of hospitals in the countries are privately run.",

These instructors need to be organized and include in a shared database by the government and accessed by implementing institutions. The information from the database will support countries to develop a plan to continuously engage qualified instructors as an essential human resource in the country. It includes maximizing its full potential by providing an opportunity to be part of the instructor team and allocate instructors to support new institutions as they develop their programs. Implementing institutions will also be able to use the database as a monitoring tool to track the level of engagement of national instructors and plan if refresher training is required, including provide updates through communication outreach.The PEER Program has developed a regional database to be hand over for nodal agencies to manage and maintain by the 3rd quarter of 2021. The countries will be able to use the said database for this purpose.",

                "description": "Accreditation and certification are both quality management processes but have two different uses. Generally, certification is given to individuals, and accreditation applies to organizations or institutions.As an integral part of PEER institutionalization driven to maintain quality and excellence of education and learning, institutions and programs accredited by official accrediting bodies and professional associations demonstrate that an institution operates according to established qualifications or standards. It also emphasizes quality assurance and a commitment to continuous quality enhancement. Furthermore, having such accreditation adds value to the graduates in recognizing that the accredited institution maintains standards required for its graduates to gain admission to other reputable higher learning institutions or achieve credentials for professional practice.On the other hand, individuals require certification that can be part of ongoing requirements, such as continuing medical education or retesting, maintaining the certification, renewing professional licenses, or securing education credits for post-graduate degree programs. Certification represents a written assurance by the institution that educational or learning activity confers to the specified requirements and standards by the accrediting body.Therefore, accreditation authorized the institution to issue certification and use the name of the accrediting body in its certificates. An example of this is a training institution accredited by a university. The training conducted by the institution will be able to provide certification using the name of the university and award specific education units that the graduates can use to pursue higher education studies. Similarly, suppose a professional medical association provides accreditation to a training institution in conducting HOPE. In that case, that accredited institution will give certification to graduates and use the logo of the professional association. Award continuing medical education units that the graduate will be able to use in renewing profesis0onal l9censes to practice medicine as a profession. Each country needs to explore its national accreditation and certification system and targets to get accredited to provide certification for its graduates of PEER courses.",

Therefore training of emergency responders must keep up with the evolving science of practice to ensure that quality and standards are maintained in managing emergencies and reduce unnecessary loss of lives and disabilities of disaster-affected communities. Under the leadership of nodal agencies and support from national technical agencies, a system needs to be in place to regularly review, update and revise national standard curricula. A national working group needs to be in place to lead the review process or a committee if it’s an institutional level review, ideally after every 2-3 years. Quick updates and minor revisions might also occur immediately after a training activity as part of continuous improvement of the training materials. It also includes if there are important updates that require immediate changes, such as lifesaving procedures like first aid, essential life support, and CPR, including triage and INSRAG procedures and alike. Developing after-training reports should be a standard practice to document lessons from individual activities and recommendations on how the overall training activity can be improved next time.",

These training principles have transformed how training is conducted in the countries and have created strong advocates from the emergency response community, especially PEER alumni. Such training standards have even gone beyond PEER training applied to other training programs implemented by partners. However, having such rigid training standards also has some downside in which not all implementing institutions can comply. This led to the creation of parallel training of the same theme to separate PEER standards and what the partners consider the practical application of the standards. To address this issue and promote having standard training by the country and institutions, PEER training standards need to be adapted according to the capacities and current training system set up of implementing institutions. Therefore, PEER advocates for establishing minimum training standards that nodal agencies will endorse and promote, and implementing institutions can adapt. Furthermore, such measures should be established and documented to encourage implementing partners to apply to ensure quality and standardize implementation of training activities in the country.",

When PEER started in the early part of 2000, such national guidelines are in varying degrees of development. The practice of disaster risk management is at the early stages of its evolution at the national level. The absence of national operational guidelines was evident in PEER curricula that mainly reflected in its training materials universally accepted norms usually used in western countries. As part of enhancing more robust integration of national operational standards in the adapted PEER curricula, upgrading such standards in line with minimum global norms is critical for training activities to be institutionalized at the national level. This will enable emergency responders to get trained on national operational standards through the PEER courses. Standardization also promotes interoperability of national and local response, including from international disaster response teams, during large-scale disasters.",

The country needs to integrate exercises as part of its emergency preparedness culture regularly conducted. An adequately documented exercise plan, available expertise to design, conduct and evaluate exercise through an After Action Review are fundamental elements that need to be in place in simulation exercises.

Therefore, PEER can be integrated into the capacity development program for volunteers, professional responders, and hospital personnel. Regional agreements like the SAARC Agreement on Rapid Response to Natural Disasters under Article V Standard Operating Procedures on preparedness provide string linkages on the country’s commitment.

In doing so, the country and the beneficiaries of training activities can promote the national standard curricula regardless of who is leading or funding the program.A possible strategy that implementing institutions can explore is to engage the private sector through its corporate social responsibility program that mainly involves community outreach. The private sector's best interest is to support preparedness activities to reduce disaster impact in their business. It can be in the form of well-trained personnel on lifesaving skills, safety in the workplace, and other preparedness activities to support SMEs in protecting the business supply chain or the surrounding communities where most employees reside. A partnership can be explored with private  hospitals on preparedness and enhance disaster resilience like what public hospitals are benefiting from HOPE. Private hospitals can reduce disruptions and continue operating even after a significant disaster impact and increase national treatment capacity for emergency patients considering that more than 50% of hospitals in the countries are privately run.",

                "description": "Accreditation and certification are both quality management processes but have two different uses. Generally, certification is given to individuals, and accreditation applies to organizations or institutions.As an integral part of PEER institutionalization driven to maintain quality and excellence of education and learning, institutions and programs accredited by official accrediting bodies and professional associations demonstrate that an institution operates according to established qualifications or standards. It also emphasizes quality assurance and a commitment to continuous quality enhancement. Furthermore, having such accreditation adds value to the graduates in recognizing that the accredited institution maintains standards required for its graduates to gain admission to other reputable higher learning institutions or achieve credentials for professional practice.On the other hand, individuals require certification that can be part of ongoing requirements, such as continuing medical education or retesting, maintaining the certification, renewing professional licenses, or securing education credits for post-graduate degree programs. Certification represents a written assurance by the institution that educational or learning activity confers to the specified requirements and standards by the accrediting body.Therefore, accreditation authorized the institution to issue certification and use the name of the accrediting body in its certificates. An example of this is a training institution accredited by a university. The training conducted by the institution will be able to provide certification using the name of the university and award specific education units that the graduates can use to pursue higher education studies. Similarly, suppose a professional medical association provides accreditation to a training institution in conducting HOPE. In that case, that accredited institution will give certification to graduates and use the logo of the professional association. Award continuing medical education units that the graduate will be able to use in renewing profesis0onal l9censes to practice medicine as a profession. Each country needs to explore its national accreditation and certification system and targets to get accredited to provide certification for its graduates of PEER courses.",
